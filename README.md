FRCDash
=======
FRCDash is a highly extensible dashboard for the FRC competition with a focus on debugging and diagnostics utilities.  The robot communicates with the robot over a custom cross-platform networking API.  The dashboard runs on an advanced layout engine that allows users to compile layouts independent of the dashboard and implement custom GUI controls to display data.
